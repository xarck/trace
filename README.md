This app shows Spotify stats of an user. For the backend I have used NodeJS. This apps shows recently played, current songs, top songs, top artists and playlists of the user.

## **NOTE:**

Login With Your Spotify Account. After that close the app and start again then the app will be working.<br />
If App is showing "Glitch is Loading" then that means sever is starting.<br />
